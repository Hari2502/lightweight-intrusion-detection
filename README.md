# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a Python program that monitors network traffic, detects suspicious patterns indicative of cyber attacks, and generates alerts. It provides a basic rule-based approach to network security, allowing users to identify potential threats and take appropriate action.

## Features

- Rule-Based Detection: The IDS employs a rule-based approach, allowing users to define custom rules to detect specific patterns or signatures associated with cyber attacks.
- Network Traffic Monitoring: The program captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time, enabling the detection of suspicious activities or anomalies.
- Alert Generation: When a suspicious pattern is detected, the IDS generates alerts, providing information about the detected threat for further investigation.
- Configurable Rules: Users can easily add or modify rules based on their specific security requirements and adapt the IDS to changing threat landscapes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/intrusion-detection-system.git

2. Run the IDS program:
python ids.py

3. Customize the rules in the ids.py file to match your desired detection patterns.

Usage
Run the IDS program to start monitoring network traffic.
As network traffic is captured, the IDS analyzes packets and checks for matches with the defined rules.
When a suspicious pattern is detected, an alert is generated, indicating the potential cyber threat.
Review the generated alerts for further investigation and initiate appropriate response actions.
Customization
Rule Definition: Modify the rules in the ids.py file to match specific attack patterns or signatures.
Alert Handling: Customize the program to trigger additional actions, such as sending email notifications or integrating with a security incident management system.
